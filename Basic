Here are the Solutions for the Basic Level in the HACKTHISSITE.org challenge

1> Inspect the HTML Code, And search for the keyword "Password". it will be one of the results of the search.
<--  the first few levels are extremely easy: password is 0a865b03 -->

2> Just leave the password field empty, Done.

3> Right click around the left of the password box and inspect element. there is a hidden input box, that submits the file to password.php
   add password.php to the end of the current link, you will be redirected to a file with the unencrypted password.
   
   <form action="/missions/basic/3/index.php" method="post">
   <input type="hidden" name="file" value="password.php" />
   
   use URL https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/3/password.php

   password 77498e63

4> Right click on the button that sends the password to SAM.
   replace email ID mentioned in the post command, and click the button.
   you will get an email that has the password.
   NOTE : You must provide the same email with which you are registered.

    <form action="/missions/basic/4/level4.php" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="to" value="sam@hackthissite.org">
    <input type="submit" value="Send password to Sam"></form></center>

5> Similar to 4. Follow the same steps.
   only a slight difference in the code exists, the file is not called password.php
   
   <center>
    <form action="/missions/basic/5/level5.php" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="to" value="sam@hackthissite.org">
    <input type="submit" value="Send password to Sam"></form></center>


6> The Encrypted password is bb6diijm.
   put an input of aa1aaaaa to encryption calculator.
   you will notice an output of ab3defgh
   i.e first remains the same, second increases by 1, third increases by 2, etc.
   therefore the solution is ba4aeddf

7> This level uses a perl script.The admin has created a perl file, that runs the CAL command.we can use '&&' command and attach an 'ls' command, to the end of it.
   This allows us to list the directory and find the obfuscated password file.
   
   2019 && ls

   This lists the entire 2019 calendar, after which it lists the directory. 
   index.php
   level7.php
   cal.pl
.  k1kh31b1n55h.php

   go to the https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/7/k1kh31b1n55h.php
   
8> In this the creator uses PHP variables in the back end. We can tell this by the input type used and the script the control is returning to.
   <form action="/missions/basic/8/level8.php" method="post">
   <input type="text" name="name">
   <input type="submit" value="submit"></form>
   
   That means we can submit a command to execute Shell commands in place of the variable.
   <!--#exec cmd="ls ../" -->
   This creates a file with the name That is the list of all files in the directory.
   
   Your file has been saved. Please click here view the file.
   
   Hi, au12ha39vc.php index.php level8.php tmp! Your name contains 39 characters.
   Visit au12ha39vc.php to et the password.

9> use the site for problem 8. specify the command but alter it to point to the directory for example 9.
   <!--#exec cmd="ls ../../9" --> 
   this lists all directories in 9.
   Your file has been saved. Please click here view the file.
   Hi, index.php p91e283zc3.php! Your name contains 24 characters.  
   Visit p91e283zc3.php.
   You will get the password.

10> So 10, is similar to 9 & 8, but the same command will not work as the admin has now protected against it.
    Notice that when you click on submit, with any password, we get, you are not authorised to view this page notice.
    This is done using a Cookie, that has authorisation set to no.
    Change that to yes and reload the page!
    You're in.

11> This one is the most fun!
    When we click on the link for excerscise 11, it just displays a Statement that mentions a song.
    upon Refreshing, you get a new song, and another new song. A pattern here is that all the songs are by elton john.
    so at the end of the url append an 'e'. And viola, you have the Parent diectory listed.
    follow the trail of letters that spells out e l t o n. and you will find yourself in a blank directory. 
    Here you can use .htaccess at the end of the url. This gives you a listing called DaAnswer.
    This results in the following message being printed.
    The answer is not what you think! Just look a little harder.
    as the statement says,
    not what you think - is the password.
